This codebase was created to demonstrate a simple application for iOS built with [SwiftUI]

The goal was to train animation and transition in SwiftUI.

# How it works

This is an application written in [Swift] that utilizes [SwiftUI] for developing the mobile app.

You have two screens and a slider to go to the second one.

Interacting with the character on the first screen will demonstrate a simple parallax effect.

# Getting started

* Install [Xcode]
* Build and develop
